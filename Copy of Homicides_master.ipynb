This analysis includes the investigation of a number of homicide-related issues, including victim\n","characteristics, crime scenes, suspects' intentions, and the influence of societal, economic, and\n","environmental factors.\n","\n","  Homicide is a serious social problem with ramifications across society. It affects not only the\n","criminal justice system but also critically affects social and public health. The focus of our study is to\n","look deeply into homicide report data, which normally contains details about each homicide case,\n","including the date, time, location, victim's characteristics, suspect information, cause of death, and, in\n","some circumstances, the crime's motivation.\n","\n","\n","\n","##**Questions of Interest:**\n","\n","We have developed  detailed and business-minded questions, which we will be addressing with our research and visualizations, following a careful review of the earlier inquiries and concept brainstorming. These inquiries will provide a more thorough understanding of the issues that our projects aims to address.\n","\n","● What are the primary demographic traits of homicide perpetrators and victims, and how have they\n","changed over time? What was the most affected segment of the population?\n","\n","● What are the most frequent causes/weapons used in homicides, and how do they alter depending\n","on geography and demographics? What are the regions or cities that have the most homicides and\n","which causes are the most prevalent in each state?\n","\n","● Are there times when the number of homicides significantly rises or falls, and if so, what may\n","have caused these changes—such as modifications to policy, changes in the economy, or\n","adjustments to law enforcement tactics? Would any economic suffering or recession period\n","contribute a significant effective relation to the frequency of homicide? Does the frequency vary\n","based on season?\n","\n","● Does the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator matter? Is it more common that the\n","two sides know each other or don’t?\n","\n","● For the crimes that were solved, which agency types were the most effective? Which states’\n","agencies were the best at solving the crimes? Which were the worst?\n","\n","\n","\n"," # **Milestone and Progress**\n","\n","**Task 1 (Due- 10/22/2023- completed )** : Access the quality of the data, Deciding whether or not predictive analysis is feasible, and method of data storage, Managing missing data, and exploratory data analysis.\n","\n","  The first step in our analytical process is a thorough examination of our dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to evaluate its dependability and quality. Together, we assess the viability of predictive analysis while taking into account the subtleties and features of the dataset. Simultaneously, choices are made about how to store data and how to rearrange information such that it is readable. It becomes a collaborative effort to address missing data and put in place efficient data cleaning procedures, which enhances the overall accuracy of our analysis. This cooperative method guarantees our investigation is not only technically sound but also understandable and perceptive, laying the groundwork for a significant examination of our dataset.\n","\n","  **Task 2 ( Due - 11/07/2023- completed )** : Indexing/ Selection/ Filtering, Merging and reshaping data Stacked bar chart , Geospatial analysis, Time series analysis ,Demographic analysis. -\n","\n","  As our project advances, we start a systematic process of indexing, selecting, and filtering, meticulously selecting the dataset to extract relevant data. This painstaking step prepares the groundwork for efficient data transformation, as well as the combining and repurposing of data, in which our combined efforts simplify the information into a more logical and significant shape. Using this improved dataset as a foundation, we use visual tools like stacked bar charts to extract intricate patterns and correlations from the data. We continue exploring with geospatial analysis, delving into the geographical aspects of our data to provide spatially complex insights.We next move into time series analysis to reveal the temporal features of our dataset and identify patterns and trends across time. At last, the focus shifts to demographic analysis, which offers a thorough comprehension of the many attributes included in our dataset.\n","\n","  **Task 3 (Due -11/10/2023- completed )**: Finding observations ,Creating inferences, Markdowns ,Comments ,Code review, Scrum style meetings.\n","\n","  In order to locate important patterns and insights, we must first carefully search through our dataset for observations. Expanding upon these findings, we started drawing conclusions and drawing inferences that add significance to the story of our research. We use comments and markdowns to expedite communication and documentation, guaranteeing transparency and clarity in our cooperative process. Using a code review methodology, we collaborate to assess and improve our code for efficacy and efficiency .\n","\n","Most of the things we listed in our project proposal timetable, we were able to do.\n","\n","**For our next steps:**\n","\n","We plan to use a variety of visualization techniques in the next phase of our project, such as making a Sunburst chart to display hierarchical data relationships, a Scatter plot to find possible correlations, and a Cluster chart to look for patterns in the dataset. To guarantee a strong training and testing phase for our models, we will deliberately divide the dataset in half at the same time. After that, our project will focus on training machine learning models, which will use algorithms to find patterns and connections in the data. Ultimately, we will use the trained models to produce predictions, which will provide insightful information and further the main objectives of our research. This comprehensive strategy uses machine learning and visualization techniques to extract valuable information from our dataset.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_hzAsj24jUlz"},"id":"_hzAsj24jUlz"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Data Acquisition:**\n","\n","  We start with importing data from Kaggle, where we carefully review a CSV file to make sure it is appropriate for our analysis environment. After that, we turn our attention to data cleansing and missing data management, which is a comprehensive review process that includes finding and addressing missing or unnecessary information as well as getting rid of duplicate records. We perform basic evaluations to comprehend data distributions, identify outliers, and display patterns that serve as a basis for more in-depth insights before fluidly transitioning into exploratory data analysis.we investigate victim age, sex, weapon type, offender sex, and victim race by utilizing the analytical features of libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Age distribution is shown, and gender, the use of weapons, and the demographics of the offenders are all subtly understood by filtering procedures. We utilize MATLAB's robust data visualization features to clarify the weapon and victim race distribution in the

It will be represented using a double bar for each year, with one bar being the perpetrators and the other being the victims which is then stacked by demographics within each bar. This will provide us with an easy method of viewing all information needed in order to tackle a question like this. We can use this type of chart to analyze different demographic traits, such as: male vs. female by type of crime, number of perpetrators vs. number of victims by year, etc. ADJUST WORDING"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f813738d","metadata":{"id":"f813738d","outputId":"103eeb52-93d1-462a-8477-18f7cc260258"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["Record ID\n","1          Alaska\n","2          Alaska\n","3          Alaska\n","4          Alaska\n","5          Alaska\n","           ...   \n","638450    Wyoming\n","638451    Wyoming\n","638452    Wyoming\n","638453    Wyoming\n","638454    Wyoming\n","Name: State, Length: 638454, dtype: object"]},"execution_count":24,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["states = homicides_df['State']\n","states"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 4 :\n","Does the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator matter?
